## Dataset

The Fashion MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, categorized into 10 classes:
- 0: T-shirt/top
- 1: Trouser
- 2: Pullover
- 3: Dress
- 4: Coat
- 5: Sandal
- 6: Shirt
- 7: Sneaker
- 8: Bag
- 9: Ankle boot

You can find more information about the dataset [here](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist).

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/your-username/fashion-mnist-cnn.git`
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run `python train.py` to train the CNN model on the Fashion MNIST dataset.
4. Once training is complete, you can evaluate the model's performance by running `python evaluate.py`.
5. You can also use the trained model for inference by running `python predict.py`.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model architecture used in this project consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, dropout for regularization, and fully connected layers for classification. You can find the details of the model architecture in the `model.py` file.

## Results

After training the model, you can expect to see the accuracy and loss metrics printed in the console. Additionally, the `evaluate.py` script provides a detailed evaluation of the model's performance on the test set.
