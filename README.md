Fashion MNIST Image Classification using CNN
This repository contains code for training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images from the Fashion MNIST dataset. The Fashion MNIST dataset is a collection of 28x28 grayscale images of various fashion items belonging to 10 different classes. The objective of this project is to build a model that can accurately classify these images into their respective categories.

Dataset
The Fashion MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, each belonging to one of the following classes:

0: T-shirt/top
1: Trouser
2: Pullover
3: Dress
4: Coat
5: Sandal
6: Shirt
7: Sneaker
8: Bag
9: Ankle boot
You can find more information about the dataset here.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
TensorFlow
NumPy
Matplotlib
Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine using git clone https://github.com/your-username/fashion-mnist-cnn.git
Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Navigate to the repository directory.
Run python train.py to train the CNN model on the Fashion MNIST dataset.
Once training is complete, you can evaluate the model's performance by running python evaluate.py.
You can also use the trained model for inference by running python predict.py.
Model Architecture
The CNN model architecture used in this project consists of multiple convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers, dropout for regularization, and fully connected layers for classification. You can find the details of the model architecture in the model.py file.

Results
After training the model, you can expect to see the accuracy and loss metrics printed in the console. Additionally, the evaluate.py script provides a detailed evaluation of the model's performance on the test set.
